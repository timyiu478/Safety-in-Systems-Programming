# Safety in Systems Programming

The Repository contains the learning materials of the [Safety in Systems Programming](https://reberhardt.com/cs110l/spring-2020/) course by Ryan Eberhardt and Armin Namavari.

This course is focused on safety and robustness in systems programming: 

- Where do things often go wrong in computer systems? 
- How can we avoid common pitfalls? 
- Use the Rust programming language as a vehicle to teach **mental models and paradigms** that have been shown to be helpful in preventing errors, and we will look at how these features have made their way back into C++.
    - It's in Rust but not a Rust class
